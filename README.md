# General Engineering Facial Recognition
In this project, we wrote a set of user-defined functions in order to perform a very basic implementation of face recognition. 
Face recognition is a very active and popular research topic that is used for a range of different fields from application development to security systems. Each face recognition system requires a face database. 
(Otherwise it would not know whom to recognize!) As the face database in this project, we will use the faces of 100 National Basketball Association (NBA) players.

**Worked on this project with a partner in Fall of 2019. The file uploaded is our work.**

All work was done in MatLab's 2019 version released in September 2019.
